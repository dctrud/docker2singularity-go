# docker2singularity-go

**PROOF OF CONCEPT - NOT YET TIDY/PRODUCTION CODE!**


This is a reimplementation of docker2singularity that:

  * Is written in Go
  * Is compiled and has no runtime dependency on docker or singularity
  * Creates sandbox containers at this time
  
Has been written as:

  * A proof of concept for creating singularity containers from docker registry
    images in Go
  * A troubleshooting/verification tool for docker container issues 


## Currently Does...

  * Pull from any endpoint supported by containers/image (docker registry, archives, oci layouts etc.) 
  * Build a singularity sandbox with runscript and env set
  
## Does not yet...

  * Properly fix the env yet (need to exclude things, proper quoting etc.)
  * Build an image, only sandbox

## To build
You will need to install another go module called trash, which will help handle some of the Docker dependencies. It is called "trash". The following command will install an executable "trash" into your `$GOPATH/bin`

```
$ go get github.com/rancher/trash
```

and then you can run it to build this executable.

```
$ trash
$ go build
```

If you do not need ostree support, or do not have gpgme available you can use
build tags to exclude those features of `containers/image`:

```
$ go build --tags "containers_image_openpgp containers_image_ostree_stub"
```


## Pulling dockerhub images...

You must run where you built it for now!

## Pulling private docker registry images...

The docker2singularity-go tool can use your `docker login` config to access private
registries, such as the NVIDIA GPU Cloud.

E.g. to pull docker images from the NVIDIA GPU Cloud into a singularity sandbox:

```sh
# First configure your login per the instructions on the GPU cloud site: 
$ docker login nvcr.io
Username: $oauthtoken
Password:
Login Succeeded

# Now you pull a GPU cloud container into a singularity sandbox
$ ./docker2singularity-go docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/caffe:18.01-py2 nvcr_caffe_sandbox/
...

# And run with Singularity...
$ singularity run --nv nvcr_caffe_sandbox/

## Other formats to Singularity sandboxes...

Through the use of `containers/image` this tool supports more than `docker://`
hub/registry URIs. You can create sandboxes from:

  - docker archives
  - docker-daemon managed containers
  - oci directories
  - oci archives
  - ostree
  - tarballs
